# map-projections
 
This repo contains Python scripts to create several global map projections. It reads world boundaries as polygons from included shapefiles (.shp, .shx, .dbf) that are stored using the global lat-long coordinates and remaps them to a [-1, 1] x, y coordinate system. This is an unfinished project and there are improvements to be made.

## Included Projections
* [Polar/Azimuthal Equidistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuthal_equidistant_projection) projection in polar.py
